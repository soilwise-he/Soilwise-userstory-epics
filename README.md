# Soilwise Userstory Epics

The Soilwise project aims to develop an open access knowledge and data repository to safeguard soils. 
This repo is a placeholder to steer the functional requirements of the system, using a user story approach.

A selected subset of the collected [Userstory epics](https://soilwise-documentation.pages.dev/glossary/#ab15a8b55a5cbf769b61345627297d28) are listed in this repository as [issues](https://github.com/soilwise-he/Soilwise-userstory-epics/issues). They  are clustered in 5 cases and a `prototype` category:

- `prototype`; lists initial functionalities of the hub, derived from Grant Agreement and stakeholder conversations
- UC1 `Land managers`; Soil health performance indicators for Land Managers
- UC2 `Science`; Leveraging a network of Soil R&I Knowledge and Data to facilitate scientists
- UC3 `Policy`; Faciliate policy makers in policy Making & Evaluation to safeguard soil
- UC4 `Authorities`; Enhanced capacities of Public Authorities and Living Labs actors
- UC5 `Business`; Repository of new products, technologies and services

A team will be assigned to each userstory epic, which will self organize to define tasks and the assignment of those tasks.
