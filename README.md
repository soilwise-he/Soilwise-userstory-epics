# Soilwise Userstory Epics

The Soilwise project aims to develop an open access knowledge and data repository to safeguard soils. 
This repo is a placeholder to steer the functional requirements of the system, using a user story approach.

A selected subset of the collected [Userstory epics](https://soilwise-documentation.pages.dev/glossary/#ab15a8b55a5cbf769b61345627297d28) are listed in this repository as [issues](https://github.com/soilwise-he/Soilwise-userstory-epics/issues). They  are clustered in 5 cases and a `prototype` category:

- `prototype`; lists initial functionalities of the hub, derived from Grant Agreement and stakeholder conversations
- UC1 `Land managers`; Soil health performance indicators for Land Managers
- UC2 `Science`; Leveraging a network of Soil R&I Knowledge and Data to facilitate scientists
- UC3 `Policy`; Faciliate policy makers in policy Making & Evaluation to safeguard soil
- UC4 `Authorities`; Enhanced capacities of Public Authorities and Living Labs actors
- UC5 `Business`; Repository of new products, technologies and services

A team will be assigned to each userstory epic, which will self organize to define tasks and the assignment of those tasks.


## Requirements Extraction
In order to extract the requirements ensuing from the individual Userstory Epics, a list of requirement categories has been defined aligned with different functionalities of SWR.
For the first 14 Userstory Epics provided as GitHub Issues, requirements ensuing from the Userstory Epics have been extracted for these requirement categories.
When future Userstory Epics are defined, these requirement categories can be used as inspiration for potential interaction points between the User and SWR

The requirement categories are as follows:
- 01.1 - Data Discovery - Query Catalogue
- 01.2 - Data Discovery - map preview 
- 01.3 - Data Discovery - chatbot 
- 02 - Metadata creation
- 03 - Metadata feedback
- 04 - Download data
- 05 - Upload data
- 06 - Data quality checks
- 07 - Harvesting
- 08 - Vocabulary
- 09 - Knowledge
- 10 - Data harmonization
- 11 - Processing
- 12 - Methodologies, guidance
- 13 - Networking
- 14 - Security
